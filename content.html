                <p>
                  New Orleans's Mardi Gras celebration will definitely look a bit different in 2021, but thankfully the
                  festivities aren't completely off.

                </p>

                <p> in 2021, the holiday — also known as "Fat Tuesday" — will take place on Feb 16. Due to the fact that
                  it's a religious holiday, it won't be canceled entirely, but parades and mass gatherings that New
                  Orleans is famous for won't be happening.

                  read, but depending on what COVID-19 restrictions look like in February, there may still be some small

              <h3>Why the colors Green Gold & purple</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                  The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are green, gold, and purple. The
                  colors were first specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their
                  inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is
                  unknown why these specific colors were chosen; some accounts suggest that they were initially selected
                  solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true symbolism
                </p>
                <p class="hide">
                  Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization, presented a theory
                  that the colors were based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and Rex's
                  goal may have been to create a tricolor to represent their "kingdom". Purple was widely associated
                  with royalty, while white was already heavily used on other national flags, and was thus avoided.
                  Furthermore, he noted that a flag in green, gold and purple in that order complies with the rule of
                  tincture, which states that metals (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next to other colors, and
                  that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors.

                <p class="hide">
                  Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and gold-colored floats
                  themed around the concepts, the Rex organization retroactively declared that the three colors in that
                  order symbolized justice, power, and faith. The traditional colors are commonly addressed as purple,
                  green, and gold, in that order—even though this order violates the rule of tincture.
